# final_experience_buffer_and_cnn_model.ipynb

## Description

This project explores a hybrid approach that combines **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** with **meta-decision-making** strategies to intelligently manage an experience buffer used for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the MNIST dataset. The agent learns **which data to collect and prioritize** for improving classification accuracy.

## Features

- Custom experience buffer with sampling strategy
- CNN model trained on prioritized data
- Cosine similarity for relevance scoring
- Evaluation on the MNIST dataset
- Reinforcement-learning-inspired data selection logic

## Core Concepts

- **MetaDecisionNet**: Using an RL-like policy to determine which training samples are most useful.
- **Experience Buffer**: Maintains a pool of training samples and selects the most relevant ones for training.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Scores similarity between data features to guide selection.
- **Convolutional Neural Network**: A basic CNN implemented in PyTorch for digit classification.

## File Structure

- `final_experience_buffer_and_cnn_model.ipynb`: Main notebook combining data selection strategy and CNN training.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- numpy
- scikit-learn
